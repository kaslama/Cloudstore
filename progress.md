## üöß In Progress

- [ ] **AES Encryption (at upload)**  
  Files should be encrypted using AES before storage and decrypted when downloaded. This is a priority.

- [ ] **Client-side Delete (JS-enhanced UI)**  
  JavaScript is now used for delete actions without reloading the page, but needs confirmation & error handling.

- [ ] **Error Handling + Notifications**  
  Need better messages for empty folders, errors, and success alerts.

## ‚ùå Not Started

- [ ] **CSRF Protection**  
  Forms and actions should include tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery.

- [ ] **XSS Protection**  
  All user-generated content (file names) should be sanitized properly.

- [ ] **File Sharing**  
  Ability to generate a shareable link or share with specific users.

- [ ] **File Duplication Check**  
  Prevent users from uploading files with same names or contents.

- [ ] **Information Hiding (Private Files)**  
  Ensure only the owner can view/download their files. Implement if public files are added later.

- [ ] **File Versioning**  
  Store multiple versions of the same file if re-uploaded, instead of overwriting.

- [ ] **Overwrite Handling**  
  Warn before overwriting existing files or handle version control.

- [ ] **ORM Integration (Optional)**  
  Optionally integrate an ORM like Eloquent or Doctrine if time permits.
